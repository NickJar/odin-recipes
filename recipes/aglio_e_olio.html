    <h3>A simple yet tasty pasta dish!</h3>
    <p>No two spaghetti aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method.</p>
    <p> The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden-brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, 
    <br>you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of olive oil</li>
        <li>red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Fresh Parsley</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>parmigiano-reggiano</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, <br>
            stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. <br>
            Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li><br>
        <li>Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. <br>
            Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, <br>
            about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li><br>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, <br>
            and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.</li>
    </ol>
